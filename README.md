# Advent of Code 2016

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) written in Rust.

Run specify day: `cargo run -- dayXX` or  `cargo test -- dayXX`  
Run all days (optimized): `cargo run --release`

Uses a procedural macro and unorthodox `pub use` to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code necessary.
